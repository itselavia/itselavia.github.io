<p>I'm Akshay Elavia, a software guy, comedy nerd and spicy memes aficionado. I maintain this blog to document my learnings along my career. Also, it helps me polish my technical writing and diagramming skills which I feel is the most underrated quality for software professionals. The topics cover mainly cloud, security and DevOps technologies with a slight leaning towards infrastructure automation and containerization.</p>
<p>I have worked in this domain in large and medium sized companies in India for over 4 years. Currently, I'm pursuing my Masters Degree in Software Engineering from San Jose State University.</p>
<p>Please feel free to reach out to me on any of the platforms listed below regarding any particular post or feedback. I have relied heavily on blogs like these to learn new things while starting out, and I can't stress enough how instrumental they have been in solidifying my conceptual understanding. It's my attempt to give back to the community which has showered me with such great learning. Hope you find some of my writing helpful!</p>
